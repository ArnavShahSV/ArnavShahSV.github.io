                        <p>My name is Jean Valijean. I have spent most of life under the scrutiny of poverty and the justice system. I first went to jail 
                            for Five Years for stealing some bread for my poor family and famished children. I attempted to escape to reunite with my family and feed them. I tried to escape 4 times and my 5 year sentence quickly turned into a 19 year sentence. I would have 
                            given anything to be there for my family and to support them. My biggest fear and enemy is Javert. He was extremely against me while I was in prison and made sure to monitor my every move. He doesn't understand that I am not some kind of animal and that I am human, just like him. My name is not Prisoner 24601, but indeed it is Jean Valijean. I have a name and I have a family. I am not like the others in this prison, I am just here for stealing a small loaf of bread, so I could feed my family; not for killing a man. </p>

                        <p> Bishop Myriel. The name of my knight in shining armor. The first night I was out of prison I stumbled across his house in the village of Digne. He let me spend the night, gave me food, and was very hospitable. However, my foolish self woke up in the night and stole all of the Bishop's silverware. I was caught not far down the road, suspect immediately because of my clothes and uncontrolled facial hair. The police took me back to the Bishop's house and demanded I return the silverware. I thought I was doomed, back to prison for another 5 years. The Bishop lied and told the officer that he had indeed gifted the silverware to me. That instant changed my life forever. Afterwards, I was devoted to being a new man and leaving my past behind. I took on a new appearance and adopted my lovely daughter, Cosette. Cosette and I had a lovely life for the most part. It all continued to go downhill when the fool Javert reappeared, more on that later. Marius was Cosette's young love, for which I did not approve at all. This led to depression;however, their relationship worked out in the end. I changed my life so much I became the mayor. </p>

                        <p> Javert, the one person I despise the most. Throughout my time in prison, I was constantly pestered by Javert. The video on the right exemplifies the type of verbal harrassment I endured throughout my time in prison. Even after I got released from prison and got sent back and escaped, everyone presumed I was dead. Javert somehow managed to track me and my daughter back to our town. This put us both on the run. The trauma that was endured by my daughter is more than any five year old should ever experience in their whole life. Javert decided to take his own life after chasing my daughter and I. He decided that the world could only have Valijean or Javert, not both.</p>
